# Source Notes

Document search with exact source quotes and a note review step.

## Run it

Install Python 3.12 or newer and Docker with Compose. Run these commands from this repo's root:

```sh
python scripts/setup.py
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5403. Sign in as `demo`, using the `DEMO_PASSWORD` in your new `.env` file. The setup script makes random local passwords. It keeps existing settings when run again.

Click Load sample guides, then ask who must approve a stock adjustment. Local search needs no API key.

The ports bind to localhost. Stop the app with `docker compose stop`. Saved data stays in a Docker volume. Starting with `docker compose up -d` keeps those records. The screenshots show a workspace after following the sample tasks; a fresh database has less history.

## Check it

Tests use a separate database and ports. They do not edit the demo database.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
# Activate .venv using the command for your shell.
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/setup.py --test
docker compose --env-file .env.test -f compose.test.yaml up --build -d
python scripts/wait_ready.py
python -m pytest tests integration -q
docker compose --env-file .env.test -f compose.test.yaml down
```

The Docker build runs TypeScript checks and builds the React frontend. Python tests cover validation and service behavior. Integration tests send real HTTP requests and check PostgreSQL records. The workflow runs the same steps on GitHub. Open its badge for the result of the current commit.

## Structure

- `web/src`: React pages, TypeScript requests, and CSS.
- `app`: Python routes, database access, and processing logic.
- `app/schema.sql`: tables and database rules.
- `integration`: complete requests against the running API and test database.
- `docs`: screenshots, measured results, and explanations.

## Scope

This is a personal learning project with sample data. The app runs locally; the public project page is a walkthrough. It is not a production service or software used by a former employer.

Local retrieval uses hashed word vectors, not trained semantic embeddings. The optional OpenAI Responses API adapter has tests with controlled HTTP responses; it has not been tested with a paid live call. It only selects quotes. A checked quote can still be irrelevant, and the prompt-injection checks are not complete protection. Note review uses the same demo account, not a separate approver role.

LLMs helped with implementation, tests, documentation, and explanations of unfamiliar parts of the stack. The guides are included so I can study the code and explain its decisions. See [verification notes](docs/VERIFICATION.md) for the measured checks and remaining work.
